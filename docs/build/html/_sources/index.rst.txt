Welcome to the JTrack Platform
==============================================

JTrack is an open-source platform, free of charge, for remote assessments of individuals *in situ* using smartphones.

It was developed by the Biomarker Development Group at the Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine 7 (Brain and Behaviour) of the Research Center Jülich.

JTrack is adaptable, configurable, and scalable, with a strong focus on security and privacy.

More than just a single application, it enables you to create and manage studies and share collected data in one unified platform.

If you are interested in using JTrack in your studies, please reach out to us at: biomarkers.inm7 [at] gmail.com
