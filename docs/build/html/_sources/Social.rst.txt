Active Labeling of Activities
=============================

Use *Active Labeling* to mark what you are doing in real time. This helps the study link sensor data with the correct activity.

Overview
--------

- The home screen shows **Recently completed activities** and the large **Play/Stop** control.
- Use **+** to pick or create an activity, or **▶** (arrow) to load the next scheduled one.
- Some tasks display a short **instruction** and a **preparation countdown** before starting.

Step-by-Step
------------

1) Open the Activity Screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will see your recent tasks and the main control.

2) Add or Select an Activity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tap the **+** button to add/select a task. In the **New Activity** dialog:

- **Enter activity**: type the activity name (e.g., *task 1*).
- **Duration in seconds (optional)**: set a fixed length if your study requires it; otherwise leave empty.

5) Start and Stop the Task
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Press the **Play** button to start. The timer and progress bar will run.
- Press the **Stop** button to end the task.
- When finished, the task appears under **Recently completed activities** with a timestamp.

Notes & Tips
------------

- Notifications like **“Main service started”** or **“Acceleration service started”** confirm background sensors are running.
- If you enabled **Record Audio**, Android may show a temporary green microphone indicator while recording.
- If you entered a **fixed duration**, the task ends automatically when the timer completes.
- To repeat a task, either use **▶** (load next task) or tap **+** to pick the activity again.

Troubleshooting
---------------

- **Can’t find the + button**: Scroll slightly if the Play button covers screen elements on small displays.
- **No suggestions appear**: Type the full name or create the activity once—future entries will suggest it.
- **Audio toggle missing**: Your study may not require audio; follow on-screen options only.
