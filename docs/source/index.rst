Welcome to JTrack Platform

A wide range of measurements using motion sensors (e.g. acceleration, gyroscope) as well as social activities (e.g. time spent in social networks) are extracted from the device while it is being used. Recorded are activity types (e.g. walking, running), relative location, and ecological momentary assessments.
you may perform **Active** and **Passive** data collection and adopt the open-source codes for further requirements.
